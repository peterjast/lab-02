        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Peter Staker. I'm enthusiastic about technology and I have a background in philosophy. 
            I’ve worked as a Bartender, Event Promoter, Brand Ambassador, Prosecutor Assistant and I’ve helped open two restaurants.
            Education and lifelong learning are very important to me and over these past few years, 
            I've fully committed to a growth mindset and a never-ending pursuit of knowledge. 
            I completed a web development certificate while I earned my BA from the University of Washington. 
            I was lucky enough to discover my passion for technology, development, and design, 
            which motivated me to take numerous online courses covering a broad range of technologies, tools and concepts.
            My ultimate goal is to begin my new tech career in an environment conducive to learning, growth, and professional development.
